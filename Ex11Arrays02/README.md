# Arrays (2) - IsWordPresentInCollection
Implement the IsWordPresentInCollection method, which given an array of words and a wordToBeChecked, returns true if wordToBeChecked is present in this collection and false otherwise.

For example:

For words equal to {"one", "two", "three"} and wordToBeChecked equal to "hello" the result shall be false because the word "hello" is not present in the words array.

For words equal to {"one", "two", "three"} and wordToBeChecked equal to "two" the result shall be true because the word "two" is present in the words array.
