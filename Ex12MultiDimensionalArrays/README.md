# Multi-dimensional arrays - FindMax
Implement the FindMax method, which given a two-dimensional array of integers, returns the maximal value from this array.

If any of the array's dimensions is zero, it means the array is empty, and the method should return -1.

For example:

for an empty array of size [0,3] the result should be -1

for an array like this, the result should be 12
